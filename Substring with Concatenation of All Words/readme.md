# Substring with Concatenation of All Words

You are given a string, s, and a list of words, **words**, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in **s** that is a concatenation of each word in **words** exactly once and without any intervening characters.

For example, given:

**s**: <span style="color: #c7254e;background-color:#f9f2f4">"barfoothefoobarman"</span>

**words**: <span style="color: #c7254e;background-color:#f9f2f4">["foo", "bar"]</span>

You should return the indices: <span style="color: #c7254e;background-color:#f9f2f4">[0,9]</span>.

(order does not matter).
